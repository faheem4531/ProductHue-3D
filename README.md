## About the Project

Interactive 3D Product Visualizer with Color Picker

Built with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and React, this tool enhances e-commerce websites and online platforms by allowing users to interact with 3D product models. Users can view the product from various angles and customize its appearance by selecting different colors and adjusting visual aspects.

The development process began by establishing a basic 3D scene using Three.js and React Three Fiber. This setup included creating the renderer, camera, and scene, along with the necessary lighting, materials, and textures.

3D models were then integrated into the scene, with careful adjustments to scale and material grouping to align with the mesh components. These models can either be custom-made or imported from software like Blender.

To enable customization, a color picker UI was implemented, allowing users to select specific parts of the model and modify its appearance. The tool dynamically updates the product's material based on user input.

Final touches included adding visual effects and essential user interface elements, such as buttons for model rotation and zooming.

This interactive 3D product visualizer is a valuable addition to online shopping platforms, offering users a detailed and immersive view of products, ultimately enhancing their purchasing experience.
